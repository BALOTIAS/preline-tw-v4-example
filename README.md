# PrelineUI using TailwindCSS 4 Example

This is just a small example showcase for the tailwindcss 4 variant fixes made in https://github.com/BALOTIAS/preline-tw-v4

I basically just copied the [admin template](https://preline.co/templates/admin/index.html) and adapted the stylesheet/js to be used from main.js.

There are a few small fixes I had to do to make the old tw3 template look good with tw4, see [src/style.css](./src/style.css) for more info. It also contains the basic tw4 setup boilerplate.

## How to run

Since this is basically just a VITE example app its quite straightforwards to run it.

1. Install the packages `npm install`
2. Run the dev server `npm run dev`
